# text-normalization-token-classes

This is an example of how to train TensorFlow model on a Spot Instance with [Spotty](https://github.com/apls777/spotty).

This model learns just the token classes for the data used in Sproat & Jaitly (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00068) experiments for text normalization: [https://github.com/rwsproat/text-normalization-data](https://github.com/rwsproat/text-normalization-data).
